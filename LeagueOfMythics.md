# League of Mythics

In the video game League of Legends, a recent change that was made this
season was the introduction of mythic items. These items give a strong
benefit to your character once you build the item. Riot Games (the company
that creates League of Legends) was pushing the idea of "Mythic Diversity",
the idea that in certain situtaions, it would be better for someone to build
a certain mythic item over another. We want to explore how successful this
venture is, and other interesting finds of how these items are used by
the player base.

Team members: Reed Semmel, Allen Hughes, Paul Velas, and Gregory Brown

We might be able to take one more, and we would prefer if you are
familiar with the game.
