Online Piracy: Movies/Television/Video Game torrenting and the casual relationship with piracy
===============================================================
Despite its questionable legality, piracy is an immensely popular means of consuming media. I wish to discover what sort of media is the most popular to pirate and 
how often the generally person pirates media. Possible exploration into which countries pirate the most compared to availability of media (i.e. streaming services).
