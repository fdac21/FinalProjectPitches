# Location Analysis

This project will involve creating a mobile application to track my movement as I travel and upload a history of locations to a remote database. With this data, I can perform various analyses on aspects such as where I spend the most time, the furthest distance I've traveled in a day, or how often I'm moving. This can all be presented nicely on a web interface with interactibility. For example, one way to present where I spend the most time is through a heatmap, like this one:

## Team Members

Just myself (Joey Lemon). I will probably do this project alone since it involves sensitive data with location tracking.
