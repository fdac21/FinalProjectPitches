# Super Heroes!

A nice [compiled dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/superheroes-nlp-dataset?select=superheroes_nlp_dataset.csv) exists on Kaggle that
contains various features of 1400+ super heroes. Features of interest include
`history_text`, `powers_text`, and maybe more.

One hypotheses we have intially is trying to classify the super heroes by
creator. This project is an early stages and more hypotheses can be thought
of later.

Primary methods include NLP (Natural Language Processing) and deep-learning.
