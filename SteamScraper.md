## Our Idea
We would like to scrape the Steam game library for game descriptions and genre names, and see if there are correlations between word choice and genres, prices, what games are on sale, which ones have DLC. From there, we may decide to train a model to predict a game's genre based off of a description, but this is an "if we have time" goal.

We are not necessarily looking for members, since four people is probably a good number for this scope of project.
