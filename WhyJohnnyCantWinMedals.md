# The Idea
We want to analyze data from previous Olympics and sources like the World Bank to see if there are any metrics that correlate with Olympics performance and medal count.
There are several databases of olympics statistics but we can also scrape it from multiple websites if needed.
We want to see if factors such as country GDP and population can be linked with better performance.
After gathering enough data and finding factors of significant influence, we can try to use machine learning to predict future outcomes.
