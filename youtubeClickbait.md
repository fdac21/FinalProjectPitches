Like many other video sharing and social media platforms, Youtube is susceptible to clickbait. User attention is invaluable and tells us a lot about people's interests and behavior. 

There is a lot of direction of what type of data we may be interested in analyzing. Different age groups have different interests, so taking a look at the demographic of users is definitely on the top of our list.
