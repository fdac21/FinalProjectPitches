We have an idea to use Spotify API data to classify a song's popularity into 3 popularity groups (e.g., not popular, somewhat popular, popular), using attributes like danceability, loudness, decade, etc., of the song, and seeing which attributes contribute to the song's popularity the most.

Group Members: Bailey Perosa, Jessica Hamilton, Reagan Matlock
