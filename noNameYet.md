## Our Idea
We would like to scrape the Steam game library for game descriptions and genre names, and see if there are correlations between word choice and genres, prices, what games are on sale, which ones have DLC. From there, we may decide to train a model to predict a game's genre based off of a description, but this is an "if we have time" goal.
