# Fantasy Football Value Analysis

In this project we are interested in assigning value to fantasy football position rankings. This will probably be done by looking at points over replacement (i.e. next available player not on a roster) over the past several seasons.

## Team Members

We have four team members: Trent Florey, Jacob Duell, Caitlin Iadonisi, and Jake Notowich
